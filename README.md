# E-commerce Website for Artisans

This is an E-commerce website for artisans, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB Atlas account

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

2. Install the necessary npm packages for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd Public

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `Server` directory with the following content:
